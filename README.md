# keystone_query_helper
A helper for queries on Keystone (WIP)

This was put together as a helper for performing queries without repeating so much code on large sites.
It still works pretty good but it's probably kind of outdated and has multiple portions that should use a serious refactor.

##TODO:
- Change to ES6 Syntax
- Update to Mongoose/Keystone's improved populateRelated methods
- Refactor several portions for performance.
