# keystone_query_helper
A helper for queries on Keystone

This was put together as a helper for performing queries without repeating so much code on very large sites.
It still works pretty good but it's kind of outdated and has multiple portions that should use a serious refactor.

##TODO (won't get around to working on these though... This is dropped):
- Change to ES6 Syntax
- Update to Mongoose/Keystone's improved populateRelated methods
- Refactor several portions for performance and simplicity
